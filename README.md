 NotesApp (Java Console Application)

Project Overview
`NotesApp` is a simple **console-based notes manager** built in Java.  
It allows users to create, view, delete, and clear notes, all stored in a local file (`notes.txt`).  
This project demonstrates the use of **Java File I/O** (`FileWriter`, `BufferedReader`, `Files`) and basic console interaction.

 Features
- Add Note – Append a new note to `notes.txt`
- View Notes – Display all saved notes with numbering
- Delete Note (by number) – Remove a specific note
- Clear All Notes – Delete all notes with a confirmation
- Persistent Storage – Notes remain saved between runs
